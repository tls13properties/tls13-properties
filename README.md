# TLS 1.3 Security Properties

This repository has been established in an effort to derive a 'semi-official' list of the desirable security properties for TLS 1.3. To date, there have been a number of analyses pertaining to TLS 1.3 and this list aims to capture the differences, and similarities, between the various properties covered by these analyses. 

This list is intended to inform: 

* researchers,
* practioners, and,
* the TLS 1.3 specification. 

**Call for contributions:** The compilation of this list is viewed as a collaborative effort between all concerned parties (researchers, TLS WG members, etc.). Please add all relevant properties to the [Security Properties](Security-Properties.md) file.
